- **MongoDB**: Used as the database to store information about users, products, and orders.
- **Express.js**: Acts as the backend framework to handle API requests and manage server-side logic.
- **React**: Used for the frontend to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Node.js**: Provides the runtime environment for executing server-side code.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Product Management**: Admins can create, add, update, and delete products (CRUD).
- **Search Option**: Users can browse products with search functionality.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to their cart, update quantities, and remove items.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various devices to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Filter Option**: Users can filter products based on different criteria.
- **Category Management**: Users can search products by category, and admins can add different categories of bakery products.
- **Order Management**: Users can place orders, view order history, and admins can manage and update order statuses.

This project leverages the power of the MERN stack to provide a robust and scalable solution for managing an online bakery shop, ensuring efficient performance and a user-friendly interface.
